description: Reveal hidden settings on a Huawei router or modem/dongle. This
             article uses the B315/B315s, but this should work on other models
             as well. LTE bands and the DHCP DNS server are configurable this
             way.

# Show hidden Huawei router features

Huawei reuses the same interface for many of their routers, but chooses to hide
some features. Some of these may not be supported by the hardware, but others
may work fine.

The features are hidden using the HTML `hidden` attribute. To turn this
attribute off for all elements on a page, open your browser's dev tools (F12),
switch to the console tab, enter `$('#*').show()` and press Enter.

On my B315, this allows me to change the DNS server addresses sent via DHCP:
